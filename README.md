## About the project
<p>This project tackles the challenge of fostering connections within the startup ecosystem. We've built a platform that empowers startups, incubators, investors, and sponsors to connect, collaborate, and propel innovation forward.</p>
<br />
<p><b>What it does?</b></p>
<p>Imagine a central hub that combines the professional networking aspects of LinkedIn with the real-time communication features of a messaging app. That's exactly what we've created! Startups can showcase their ideas, find valuable mentorship, and connect with potential investors and sponsors. Incubators, investors, and sponsors gain access to a pool of promising ventures and can foster relationships that lead to mutual success.</p>
